We consider power calculations in the abstract (i.e., without data), and review calculations that incorporate sampling variability when effect sizes are estimated from collected data. Power calculated from estimated effect sizes have been used to (a) design future research (b) characterize the power of designs used in a literature that served as input to the power calculation, or to (c) evaluate whether the obtained results can be trusted. We end with an open discussion on these uses of power. \n\n\nBio\nDr. Jolynn Pek is an associate professor of Quantitative Psychology in the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University.

    "text": "Date: April 27, 2021\nSpeaker: Christopher R. Beam, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology and Gerontology\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nAbstract\nBehavioral scientists are often faced with a large, potentially daunting list of possible models that may be applied to any given data set. While in the best case, the specific model is chosen based solely on an intricate and well-defined theory about the process being modeled, this is not always the case. Instead, scientists frequently fall back on one of a small subset of models with which they are familiar and consider these models sufficient to test the question of interest. We demonstrate that different developmental models - all designed to identify or describe some developmental process - can be fit to the same observed data and provide adequate model fit. Longitudinal data are simulated according to three developmental processes: a linear growth trajectory, an autoregressive process, and a damped linear oscillator. Regardless of the process that generated the data, adequate model fit can be found by misfitted models. Study results eventually will serve as the basis for the development of a new tool in the OpenMx software package that provides applied developmental researchers with a suite of developmental models to contrast and compare. The ultimate goal of this project is to assist behavioral researchers in capturing actual development processes in their populations of interest rather than merely relying on model fit indices as the basis for concluding that development occurs along one trajectory or another.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Beam is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Gerontology in the Department of Psychology in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.

Chris specializes in lifespan development and quantitative methods, especially longitudinal modeling. His current research interests are numerous, ranging from cognitive development and aging, late-life loneliness and depressive symptomatology, bereavement, and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. A central goal of his research is to understand the proximal and distal processes that allow people to maximize their genetic potential for healthy outcomes (e.g., cognition) while minimizing potential for negative outcomes (e.g., depression)."

Standardized effects are increasingly reported in treatment studies, to facilitate interpretation, future meta-analysis, and study comparison. However, when outcome data are missing, achieving an unbiased, accurate estimate of the sATE can be challenging, given that the sATE is a ratio of a (sometimes adjusted) mean difference to a (within-group) standard deviation. The simulation study I will describe compares missing data strategies, specifications, and modeling choices in terms of bias and accuracy. Populations with homogeneous and heterogeneous variances are considered, as well as multiple different missingness patterns relevant to these types of studies. The results show that although the sATE can be estimated with little bias using either maximum likelihood or multiple imputation, particular attention should be paid to the model and variance estimator, especially at smaller sample sizes. In addition to presenting simulation results, I will include demonstration of how and why certain choices lead to bias when estimating the sATE."

Collins, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics\nSchool of Global Public Health\nNew York University\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nMulticomponent behavioral and biobehavioral interventions are used widely for prevention and treatment of health problems and promotion of health and educational achievement. These interventions are typically developed and evaluated using a treatment package approach, in which the intervention is assembled a priori and evaluated by means of a two-group randomized control trial (RCT). In this presentation I will briefly introduce an expanded methodological framework for developing, optimizing, and evaluating behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. This framework, called the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), is a principled approach that integrates ideas from behavioral science, engineering, multivariate statistics, health economics, and decision science. MOST enables the investigator to balance intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency to achieve intervention EASE. Using MOST, behavioral and biobehavioral interventions can be optimized to meet an objective chosen by the investigator. The objective may be any reasonable goal, such as an intervention that offers the best expected outcome achievable without exceeding a specified upper limit on implementation cost or time. MOST relies heavily on resource management by strategic choice of highly efficient experimental designs, including the RCT where appropriate. Recent advances include an approach to identifying cost-effective interventions. I propose that MOST offers several benefits, including more rapid long-run improvement of interventions, without requiring a dramatic increase in research resources.\n\n\nBio\nLinda M. Collins is Professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics in the School of Global Public Health, New York University.

The objective of MOST is to improve intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency, balancing these strategically to achieve intervention EASE. Dr. Collins has collaborated on research applying MOST in a range of areas, including HIV, smoking cessation, prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and weight loss.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: October 5, 2021\nSpeaker: Hudson Golino, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology\nUniversity of Virginia\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nThe current presentation will show how a new ﬁt index for dimensionality analysis termed total entropy ﬁt index can be applied to tune the number of embedded dimensions used in the dynamic exploratory graph analysis (DynEGA) technique. DynEGA uses dynamical systems and network psychometrics to estimate the number of (dynamic) latent factors in multivariate time-series of continuous or categorical data. For each time series generalized local linear approximation (GLLA) is used to compute n-order derivatives for each individual. The stacked matrix of derivatives (combined row-wise) is then used to estimate a network structure in which communities represent dynamical factors. GLLA requires the user to set the number of embedded dimensions to transform each time series into a time delay embedding matrix. In a Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the total entropy ﬁt index can be used in a grid search to ﬁnd the optimal number of embedded dimensions. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA with the TEFI optimization on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. DynEGA revealed factors (in this case latent topics) that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the U.S. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Hudson Golino completed his Ph.D. in March 2015 at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil), where he studied applications of machine learning in Psychology, Education and Health. His research focuses on quantitative methods, psychometrics and machine learning applied in the fields of psychology, health and education. He is particularly interested in new ways to assess the number of dimensions (i.e. latent variables) underlying multivariate data using network psychometrics. He has been developing a new set of quantitative techniques and metrics, integrated in a general approach – termed Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA), that is part of the relatively new area of network psychometrics. Particularly, he combines network science, information and quantum information theory, as well as computational methods to address fundamental problems in psychometrics."

At the same time, the number of different sources over which this information is divided continues to grow, creating additional obstacles for effectively combining such data so that it can be properly explored. Data fusion is one method that has been shown to facilitate more complex and more accurate analyses of combined data than those resulting from analyses of separate datasets. This presentation will introduce some recent developments in data fusion methodology via the use of the Bayesian Synthesis approach. Bayesian Synthesis is a new approach whereby results from the analysis of one dataset are exploited as prior information for the analysis of the next dataset. The presentation will also report results on the performance of Bayesian Synthesis in relation to issues regarding the order in which data are incorporated into the fusion process."

This increase largely can be attributed to greater ease in gathering numerous observations per person via the use of smart phones, automated behavioral coding, wearable technologies, and psychophysiological data. Often the end goal is to arrive at a better understanding of individuals’ processes. From these individual-level findings, we can get closer to personalized interventions as well as obtain insights into meaningful similarities across individuals and aspects of human processes that may generalize to the population. Arriving at personalized dynamic models often requires the use and adaptation of machine learning methods such as unsupervised classification, feature selection, and model-building.

    "title": "Incorporating Meta-Science in the development of mediation and moderation analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: April 6, 2023\nSpeaker: Amanda Kay Montoya, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nMediation and moderation analysis are ubiquitous throughout psychological research and help address questions about when and why effects occur. Research practices within psychology have grown and evolved in reaction to the replicability crisis, including new steps to study planning (e.g., preregistration) and increased attention to existing practices (e.g., power analysis). As such, methodologists need to incorporate these new priorities as part of their work developing and evaluating statistical methods and when creating tools to aid researchers in their analyses. In this talk, I overview my work on mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis in two-instance repeated-measures designs, a very commonly used design in psychology. I have developed an easy to use macro which can be used to estimate these models as well as implement resampling methods for inference, assist with generating plots, and many other useful features. I demonstrate how integrating meta-scientific methods to evaluate current practice in mediation and moderation, and aiding researchers in implementing preregistration and sample size planning. Overall, research suggests there is reason to be concerned about the quality of evidence from published mediation and moderated mediation results. My lab has worked to develop tools and evaluate methods for sample size planning and preregistration, which should improve this quality of evidence. I discuss future direction of my research, including extending to more complex outcomes in mediation and moderation."

    "text": "Date: May 3, 2022\nSpeaker: Zhiyong (Johnny) Zhang, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of Notre Dame\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nResearchers have repeatedly pointed out that normal data are like fantasies and have been rarely observed in social science research. However, most statistical methods have been developed for complete and normal data. In this talk, I will first review the prevalence of non-normal data in social science research and discuss their influences on statistical data analysis. Then, I will present methods we have developed to handle non-normal data in both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. I will argue that non-normal data offer unique opportunities to both methodologists and substantive researchers.\n\n\nBio\nZhiyong (Johnny) Zhang received his Ph.D. in quantitative psychology from the University of Virginia in 2008.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: February 9, 2023\nSpeaker: Stephen G. West, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nArizona State University\nFreie Universität Berlin\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nThe replication crisis has been a source of considerable concern in psychology and other sciences over the past decade. This presentation provides a methodological, philosophical, and statistical view of the replication crisis. After a brief overview, I consider recent work on three related reasons for replication failure: (1) poor methodological technique and heterogeneity of effects, (2) insufficient statistical power, and (3) reproducibility issues including undisclosed researcher degrees of freedom in reporting and “the garden of forking paths” in statistical analysis. I also consider some new developments and several proposed solutions that may mitigate problems in replicating previous studies. New methods of statistical power analysis capture the uncertainty of effect size estimates and provide more realistic estimates of required sample size. Methods related to meta-analysis that do not treat the original study as a privileged gold standard offer better information about the statistical significance, average effect size, and variability of effect size of a series of replication studies. The extensive resources devoted to the replication crisis, which only addresses the association between two variables, may have diverted attention from other equally important forms of validity in research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: December 1, 2022\nSpeaker: Kevin J. Grimm, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nArizona State University\n\nAbstract\nItem factor analysis models can be estimated using a marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimator or a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator. The MML estimator is a full information estimator, whereas the WLS estimator is a limited-information estimator based on first and second-order moments. In single group item factor analysis, the choice of estimator is often a matter of convenience even though each estimator has benefits and limitations. However, in multiple group item factor analyses, there are parameter and specification differences as unique factor variances can be estimated under certain conditions using WLS estimators. Thus, when examining measurement invariance with WLS, researchers can study the invariance of the factor loadings, thresholds, and unique variances following the work of Millsap (2012). This is not the case when using MML because the unique variances are assumed to be equal across groups (or time), which places the focus on the factor loadings and the thresholds. Importantly, a lack of invariance in the unique variances over groups (and time) can masquerade as a lack of threshold invariance when using the MML estimator, which affects researchers’ ability to compare latent variable scores over groups (and time). This issue and the importance of this distinction is illustrated using simulated and empirical data.\n\n\nBio\nKevin Grimm is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University. His research interests include multivariate methods for the analysis of change, multiple group and latent class models for understanding divergent developmental processes, nonlinearity in development, machine learning techniques for psychological data, and cognitive/achievement development.

This workshop will briefly introduce the tidyverse “mega-package” for data transformation and visualization. Topics of this workshop include how to manipulate data frames (e.g., filter out row values, select and create variables, and merge across multiple data frames), how to make histograms and scatterplots using ggplot2, and how to make reproducible HTML/PDF reports in R. The second half of the workshop will be hands-on practices with the tidyverse package. I encourage you to bring along your data set, and we can work together on the specific tasks of data manipulation and visualization for your project :)"

    "text": "Date: November 3, 2022\nSpeaker: Yichi Zhang\n\nAbstract\nFor psychological research, it is important to validate the assumption that the observed group differences are due to the true group differences in latent constructs instead of the bias inherent in the scale/survey items. In order to conclude that the observed group differences are due to the latent construct, the scale should measure the same construct equivalently for each group, which is the concept of measurement invariance (MI). In this event, we will cover the basics of measurement invariance testing followed by an illustrative example using the R package lavaan."
