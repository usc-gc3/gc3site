We consider power calculations in the abstract (i.e., without data), and review calculations that incorporate sampling variability when effect sizes are estimated from collected data. Power calculated from estimated effect sizes have been used to (a) design future research (b) characterize the power of designs used in a literature that served as input to the power calculation, or to (c) evaluate whether the obtained results can be trusted. We end with an open discussion on these uses of power. \n\n\nBio\nDr. Jolynn Pek is an associate professor of Quantitative Psychology in the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University.

This increase largely can be attributed to greater ease in gathering numerous observations per person via the use of smart phones, automated behavioral coding, wearable technologies, and psychophysiological data. Often the end goal is to arrive at a better understanding of individuals’ processes. From these individual-level findings, we can get closer to personalized interventions as well as obtain insights into meaningful similarities across individuals and aspects of human processes that may generalize to the population. Arriving at personalized dynamic models often requires the use and adaptation of machine learning methods such as unsupervised classification, feature selection, and model-building. This talk focuses on the application of such methods on a few data sets collected across various domains of psychological inquiry including self-report data and functional MRI.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Kathleen Gates is an associate professor of Quantitative Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

How we do our research is changing: open science, big team science, and concerns over questionable research practices are here to stay. We've seen progress toward transparency, rigor, and the quality of our work, but these reforms largely preclude measurement practices. In this presentation I'll discuss how measurement plays a fundamental role in the quality and replicability of psychological science. I will review my metascientific research on measurement practices in original and replication research. This metascience points us to where the methods reform movement needs to go next and how methodologists can contribute.

I will discuss next steps for methodological development, particularly the need to develop practices for assessing measurement equivalence in large and complex data structures.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Flake is an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Psychology and Modelling at McGill University.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: April 19, 2022\nSpeaker: Linda M. Collins, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics\nSchool of Global Public Health\nNew York University\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nMulticomponent behavioral and biobehavioral interventions are used widely for prevention and treatment of health problems and promotion of health and educational achievement. These interventions are typically developed and evaluated using a treatment package approach, in which the intervention is assembled a priori and evaluated by means of a two-group randomized control trial (RCT). In this presentation I will briefly introduce an expanded methodological framework for developing, optimizing, and evaluating behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. This framework, called the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), is a principled approach that integrates ideas from behavioral science, engineering, multivariate statistics, health economics, and decision science. MOST enables the investigator to balance intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency to achieve intervention EASE. Using MOST, behavioral and biobehavioral interventions can be optimized to meet an objective chosen by the investigator. The objective may be any reasonable goal, such as an intervention that offers the best expected outcome achievable without exceeding a specified upper limit on implementation cost or time. MOST relies heavily on resource management by strategic choice of highly efficient experimental designs, including the RCT where appropriate. Recent advances include an approach to identifying cost-effective interventions. I propose that MOST offers several benefits, including more rapid long-run improvement of interventions, without requiring a dramatic increase in research resources.\n\n\nBio\nLinda M. Collins is Professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics in the School of Global Public Health, New York University. She previously held faculty positions at Penn State and the University of Southern California. Dr. Collins's interests are focused on development, dissemination, and application of the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired methodological framework for optimizing and evaluating behavioral, biobehavioral, biomedical, and social-structural interventions. The objective of MOST is to improve intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency, balancing these strategically to achieve intervention EASE. Dr. Collins has collaborated on research applying MOST in a range of areas, including HIV, smoking cessation, prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and weight loss. She is also collaborating on development of methods for decision-making based on the results of an optimization trial; optimizing interventions for cost-effectiveness; and optimizing adaptive interventions. Her research has been funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Science Foundation. Dr. Collins's publications have appeared in journals in the behavioral sciences, quantitative methodology, medicine, and engineering.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: October 5, 2021\nSpeaker: Hudson Golino, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology\nUniversity of Virginia\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nThe current presentation will show how a new ﬁt index for dimensionality analysis termed total entropy ﬁt index can be applied to tune the number of embedded dimensions used in the dynamic exploratory graph analysis (DynEGA) technique. DynEGA uses dynamical systems and network psychometrics to estimate the number of (dynamic) latent factors in multivariate time-series of continuous or categorical data. For each time series generalized local linear approximation (GLLA) is used to compute n-order derivatives for each individual. The stacked matrix of derivatives (combined row-wise) is then used to estimate a network structure in which communities represent dynamical factors. GLLA requires the user to set the number of embedded dimensions to transform each time series into a time delay embedding matrix. In a Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the total entropy ﬁt index can be used in a grid search to ﬁnd the optimal number of embedded dimensions. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA with the TEFI optimization on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. DynEGA revealed factors (in this case latent topics) that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the U.S. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Hudson Golino completed his Ph.D. in March 2015 at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil), where he studied applications of machine learning in Psychology, Education and Health. His research focuses on quantitative methods, psychometrics and machine learning applied in the fields of psychology, health and education. He is particularly interested in new ways to assess the number of dimensions (i.e. latent variables) underlying multivariate data using network psychometrics. He has been developing a new set of quantitative techniques and metrics, integrated in a general approach – termed Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA), that is part of the relatively new area of network psychometrics. Particularly, he combines network science, information and quantum information theory, as well as computational methods to address fundamental problems in psychometrics."
