Curran, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nIt is often said that the goal of longitudinal research is to study the course, causes, and consequences of behavior over time. The past three decades have given rise to tremendous advances in addressing the first two goals, but virtually nothing is known about the third. Whereas the standard LCM uses growth factors as dependent variables (to study the course and causes of behavioral change) it is highly desirable to use the growth factors themselves as predictors of one or more distal outcomes (to study the consequences of behavioral change). Although it is quite easy to specify the distal outcome LCM in any standard software package, there are a number of significant and unexpected complications that can drastically impact substantive conclusions. The aim of this talk is to review the standard LCM, both with and without predictors; to expand this to define the distal outcomes LCM; to highlight the critical role and unexpected consequences of the choice numerical scaling of time; to propose a principled strategy for choosing an optimal time scale; to demonstrate these methods using both simulated and real data; and to make recommendations for the use of these methods in practice."

Within Google’s Ads Human Evaluation team, we leverage human raters to assess the quality and suitability of internet advertisements. These raters provide insights into subjective aspects of ads, answering questions such as “Is this ad appropriate for children?” or “Does this ad align with the content of this website?”. The data generated from these evaluations serve several purposes, including: (a) Machine Learning: Human ratings are used to train machine learning models that select ads to be served to users; (b) Ad Selection Algorithm Evaluation: We utilize the data to evaluate AB test different algorithms; (c) Maintaining Ad Quality and Safety: Continuous monitoring of ad quality is used to quickly detect problems or issues. In this talk I will give an overview of three challenges that we encounter when collecting and using this type of data: (a) the psychometrics of ad assessment; (b) evaluating rater expertise; (c) navigating the complexities of ad quality experiments.

I will start the talk with two projects I conducted with Dr. Jack McArdle, in which we developed methods for estimating unknown change points or handling ceiling/floor data in growth curve modeling. I will illustrate the applications of the methods using two real-data examples in cognitive aging. After that, I will discuss whether, why, and how we should disaggregate within-person and between-person relations in longitudinal research. I will illustrate the applications of the methods using four real-data examples. In the first application example, I will study within-person and between-person relations of being honest to mental health. In the second and third application examples, I will investigate the within-person and between-person mediation effects of perceived discrimination on mental health in Latino youth using macro-time and micro-time longitudinal data.

    "text": "Date: April 18, 2024\nSpeaker: Ryne Estabrook, Ph.D.\nClinical Assistant Professor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nExtreme group approaches are a special case of oversampling that maximizes power by selecting cases based on extreme scores on a selection variable. In doing so, extreme group approaches retain only those cases with scores far from the population mean, increasing not only the variance of the selection variable, but also correlations and associations involving that variable. However, these methods have significant shortcomings, including the inability to effectively generalize to selection on two or more variables. To address this shortcoming, this paper proposes an alternative multivariate generalization to extreme group approaches, dubbed elliptical sampling, and compares this method to several existing methods via simulation study. Results indicate that the elliptical method outperforms traditional EGA methods, yielding maximal power and retaining the full sample covariance structure between selection variables. Selecting on more than one variable further allows researchers to test for quadratic and interaction effects, a noted shortcoming of traditional EGA methods. Finally, fitting these models via structural equation modeling reconceptualizes these designs as planned missing data, reducing R2 bias. Recommendations for use, an empirical and coding example, and future directions are discussed."

At the same time, the number of different sources over which this information is divided continues to grow, creating additional obstacles for effectively combining such data so that it can be properly explored. Data fusion is one method that has been shown to facilitate more complex and more accurate analyses of combined data than those resulting from analyses of separate datasets. This presentation will introduce some recent developments in data fusion methodology via the use of the Bayesian Synthesis approach. Bayesian Synthesis is a new approach whereby results from the analysis of one dataset are exploited as prior information for the analysis of the next dataset. The presentation will also report results on the performance of Bayesian Synthesis in relation to issues regarding the order in which data are incorporated into the fusion process."

However, the empirical Bayes (EB) estimates of random slopes, commonly used as predictors of cluster-level outcomes, are generally not reliable and could lead to biased results. While multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) accounts for such measurement error, we propose a flexible two-stage approach that is less computationally complex, yet offers similar performance to MSEM. The proposed approach is demonstrated through an empirical example of stress reactivity."

Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA reproduces asexually without recombination and is passed directly down the maternal line. This unique, non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance has long been employed in forensic identity testing, notably in the identification of King Richard III. However, it has yet to be incorporated into biometrical models. In this presentation, I will share our team’s years-long effort to leverage this singular inheritance pattern of mtDNA to estimate the proportion of variance due to variation in mtDNA (mt²). I will begin by presenting the foundational logic behind our model, followed by a description of the Utah Population Database (UPDB) and its assessment of longevity (the first phenotype under study). Delving into our analyses, I’ll present correlations between distantly-related maternal and paternal cousins using the vast UPDB dataset, which encompasses approximately 4.8 million individuals connected through over 780 billion relationships. Time permitting, I will share insights from our power analysis, examining the capabilities of the extended pedigree model under various pedigree structures. To conclude, I will discuss the practical applications and challenges of modeling mtDNA effects in the UPDB and introduce the biometrical tools in our recently-expanded R package, BGmisc."

Collins, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics\nSchool of Global Public Health\nNew York University\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nMulticomponent behavioral and biobehavioral interventions are used widely for prevention and treatment of health problems and promotion of health and educational achievement. These interventions are typically developed and evaluated using a treatment package approach, in which the intervention is assembled a priori and evaluated by means of a two-group randomized control trial (RCT). In this presentation I will briefly introduce an expanded methodological framework for developing, optimizing, and evaluating behavioral and biobehavioral interventions. This framework, called the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), is a principled approach that integrates ideas from behavioral science, engineering, multivariate statistics, health economics, and decision science. MOST enables the investigator to balance intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency to achieve intervention EASE. Using MOST, behavioral and biobehavioral interventions can be optimized to meet an objective chosen by the investigator. The objective may be any reasonable goal, such as an intervention that offers the best expected outcome achievable without exceeding a specified upper limit on implementation cost or time. MOST relies heavily on resource management by strategic choice of highly efficient experimental designs, including the RCT where appropriate. Recent advances include an approach to identifying cost-effective interventions. I propose that MOST offers several benefits, including more rapid long-run improvement of interventions, without requiring a dramatic increase in research resources.\n\n\nBio\nLinda M. Collins is Professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Biostatistics in the School of Global Public Health, New York University. She previously held faculty positions at Penn State and the University of Southern California. Dr. Collins's interests are focused on development, dissemination, and application of the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired methodological framework for optimizing and evaluating behavioral, biobehavioral, biomedical, and social-structural interventions. The objective of MOST is to improve intervention effectiveness, affordability, scalability, and efficiency, balancing these strategically to achieve intervention EASE. Dr. Collins has collaborated on research applying MOST in a range of areas, including HIV, smoking cessation, prevention of sexually transmitted infections, and weight loss. She is also collaborating on development of methods for decision-making based on the results of an optimization trial; optimizing interventions for cost-effectiveness; and optimizing adaptive interventions.

In this approach, individuals’ responses to test items are viewed as a bipartite network between respondents and items where a tie is assumed present when a respondent gives a positive answer to an item. The resulting latent space model provides a window into respondents’ performance on assessment, placing respondents and test items in a shared metric space referred to as an interaction map. The interaction map helps evaluate individuals’ strengths and weaknesses from cognitive assessment and helps identify patients’ symptom profiles from clinical assessment data. I will illustrate the utilities of the proposed approach with real data examples, focusing on how the interaction map can help derive personalized diagnostic information on individual respondents."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: December 7, 2023\nSpeaker: Zita Oravecz, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Human Development and Family Studies\nPennsylvania State University\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nSensitive and accurate measurement of change in cognitive performance is crucial for the detection of subtle cognitive change, particularly in identifying early-stage dementia risk. Smartphone-based cognitive assessments can generate an unparalleled time series of cognitive performance data by delivering ultra-brief assessments multiple times per day over several days. However, in repeated cognitive assessments, short-term within-person variability and retest learning effects can mask cognitive change due to normative cognitive aging or neurodegenerative disease progression. In this presentation, I will introduce a multi-timescale computational process modeling approach designed to disentangle cognitive processes in repeated assessments. Specifically, by using the Bayesian exponential learning model, we can extract key digital cognitive markers of processes generating observed performance over time, including learning rate, forgetting, variability, change in peak performance. This approach also enables us to leverage recent findings that indicate that processes related to cognitive task learning over time may be indicators of dementia risk. I will present results from the Einstein Aging Study demonstrating how person-specific digital cognitive markers are associated with age and mild cognitive impairment status. With this computational modeling approach, we can work towards identifying novel digital computational phenotypes of dementia risk."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: April 27, 2021\nSpeaker: Christopher R. Beam, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology and Gerontology\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nAbstract\nBehavioral scientists are often faced with a large, potentially daunting list of possible models that may be applied to any given data set. While in the best case, the specific model is chosen based solely on an intricate and well-defined theory about the process being modeled, this is not always the case. Instead, scientists frequently fall back on one of a small subset of models with which they are familiar and consider these models sufficient to test the question of interest. We demonstrate that different developmental models - all designed to identify or describe some developmental process - can be fit to the same observed data and provide adequate model fit. Longitudinal data are simulated according to three developmental processes: a linear growth trajectory, an autoregressive process, and a damped linear oscillator. Regardless of the process that generated the data, adequate model fit can be found by misfitted models. Study results eventually will serve as the basis for the development of a new tool in the OpenMx software package that provides applied developmental researchers with a suite of developmental models to contrast and compare. The ultimate goal of this project is to assist behavioral researchers in capturing actual development processes in their populations of interest rather than merely relying on model fit indices as the basis for concluding that development occurs along one trajectory or another.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Beam is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Gerontology in the Department of Psychology in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. He completed his doctoral training at the University of Virginia (2008-2015) and clinical internship at the University of Washington School of Medicine (2014-2015). Chris specializes in lifespan development and quantitative methods, especially longitudinal modeling. His current research interests are numerous, ranging from cognitive development and aging, late-life loneliness and depressive symptomatology, bereavement, and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. A central goal of his research is to understand the proximal and distal processes that allow people to maximize their genetic potential for healthy outcomes (e.g., cognition) while minimizing potential for negative outcomes (e.g., depression)."

    "text": "Date: April 26, 2024\nSpeaker: Ke-Hai Yuan, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of Notre Dame\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nModeration and mediation analyses are key methods for understanding the roles of variables in empirical research. In this talk, we review recent developments of the two methods with respect to more honest methods, more efficient parameter estimation, and more accurate measures of effect sizes, as presented in Liu and Yuan (2021), Liu et al. (2020, 2021, 2022, 2024) and Yuan et al. (2014).\nModeration occurs when the effect of the predictor on the outcome variable depends on a third variable, which is termed as the moderator. This effect is conceptually defined as the effect of the moderator on the path coefficient from the predictor to the outcome variable. The predictor and moderator are different not only in concept but also functionality. However, the effect of moderation has been implemented as an interaction effect in textbooks, software and tutorial articles. Such a treatment causes not only less efficient parameter estimates for the moderation effect itself but also wrong measures in quantifying the size of the effect. In addition, the treatment also causes problems in the study of the processes of moderated mediation and mediated moderation. The talk will cover recent methodological developments in addressing these issues by using a two-level model with single-level data. How moderated mediation is distinguished from mediated moderation will be illustrated.\nMultiple effect-size measures were proposed in mediation analysis. However, these measures are either only restricted to the three-variable mediation model or not honestly representing the mediation effect. The talk will introduce a new framework for quantifying effect sizes in mediation analysis (Liu et al., 2024). Through contributions to the explained variance of the outcome variable, this framework not only permits honest and more accurate evaluation of mediation effects via particular paths but also facilitates easy formulation of effect-size measures for complex mediation processes."

Standardized effects are increasingly reported in treatment studies, to facilitate interpretation, future meta-analysis, and study comparison. However, when outcome data are missing, achieving an unbiased, accurate estimate of the sATE can be challenging, given that the sATE is a ratio of a (sometimes adjusted) mean difference to a (within-group) standard deviation. The simulation study I will describe compares missing data strategies, specifications, and modeling choices in terms of bias and accuracy. Populations with homogeneous and heterogeneous variances are considered, as well as multiple different missingness patterns relevant to these types of studies. The results show that although the sATE can be estimated with little bias using either maximum likelihood or multiple imputation, particular attention should be paid to the model and variance estimator, especially at smaller sample sizes. In addition to presenting simulation results, I will include demonstration of how and why certain choices lead to bias when estimating the sATE."

    "text": "Date: February 20, 2025\nSpeaker: Meng Chen, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of Southern California\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nIntensive longitudinal data are often found to be nonstationary, namely, showing changes in statistical properties, such as means and variance-covariance structures, over time. One way to accommodate nonstationarity is to specify key parameters that show over-time changes as time-varying parameters (TVPs), yet abrupt transitions in TVPs can signal critical shifts in underlying processes. Identifying these shifts is particularly important in psychological research, where change points may reflect developmental transitions, intervention effects, or shifts in emotional and cognitive states. In this talk, an outlier detection method within a state-space modeling framework is proposed to detect abrupt changes in TVPs as innovative outliers. I will present findings from three simulation studies, demonstrating the method’s accuracy in detecting sudden shifts across single-subject, multivariate, and group-level models with individual-specific change points. Additionally, I will illustrate its empirical utility with facial electromyography (EMG) data collected during an emotion induction experiment."

BMRT were created to function as an alternative to monetary gambles or self-report measures to evaluate the risk taking propensity of individuals. However, they suffer from various conceptual issues within tasks and poor convergent validity between tasks laying doubt to the claim they measure risk taking at all. I explore the Columbia Card Task (CCT) in-depth as an example of conceptual issues within a task. Additionally, I compare three BMRTs to each other, a self-report measure of risk taking, and additional measures to illustrate and attempt to determine the cause of poor convergent validity between BMRT."

    "title": "On networks and online Russian trolls: How can the total entropy ﬁt index be applied to optimize the number of embedded dimensions used in dynamic exploratory graph analysis, and why does it matter?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: October 5, 2021\nSpeaker: Hudson Golino, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology\nUniversity of Virginia\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nThe current presentation will show how a new ﬁt index for dimensionality analysis termed total entropy ﬁt index can be applied to tune the number of embedded dimensions used in the dynamic exploratory graph analysis (DynEGA) technique. DynEGA uses dynamical systems and network psychometrics to estimate the number of (dynamic) latent factors in multivariate time-series of continuous or categorical data. For each time series generalized local linear approximation (GLLA) is used to compute n-order derivatives for each individual. The stacked matrix of derivatives (combined row-wise) is then used to estimate a network structure in which communities represent dynamical factors. GLLA requires the user to set the number of embedded dimensions to transform each time series into a time delay embedding matrix. In a Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the total entropy ﬁt index can be used in a grid search to ﬁnd the optimal number of embedded dimensions. In an applied example, we performed DynEGA with the TEFI optimization on a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. DynEGA revealed factors (in this case latent topics) that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the U.S. This example demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Hudson Golino completed his Ph.D. in March 2015 at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil), where he studied applications of machine learning in Psychology, Education and Health. His research focuses on quantitative methods, psychometrics and machine learning applied in the fields of psychology, health and education. He is particularly interested in new ways to assess the number of dimensions (i.e. latent variables) underlying multivariate data using network psychometrics. He has been developing a new set of quantitative techniques and metrics, integrated in a general approach – termed Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA), that is part of the relatively new area of network psychometrics. Particularly, he combines network science, information and quantum information theory, as well as computational methods to address fundamental problems in psychometrics."

    "text": "Date: October 31, 2024\nSpeaker: Ehri Ryu, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Psychology and Neuroscience\nBoston College\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nResearchers often save the estimated factor scores from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and analyze the factor scores in subsequent analyses. This talk will present a simulation study to investigate the statistical properties of the factor score estimates when there are missing values in the observed responses, particularly when the data are sparse. Assuming that the missingness occurs due to missing at random (MAR) mechanism and the MAR missingness is properly accounted for in the model, the CFA model can still be estimated to produce unbiased parameter estimates using full information maximum likelihood estimation to handle missing data. The factor scores are determined by a function of the observed response data as well as the CFA model parameter estimates. The simulation study focuses on the role of data when the parameter estimates hold desirable statistical properties. The first part of the simulation study evaluates the statistics associated with the saved factor scores. In the second part, a number of different ways of using the saved factor scores are explored as an attempt to overcome the poor performance of the saved factor scores when they are estimated with sparse response data."

This increase largely can be attributed to greater ease in gathering numerous observations per person via the use of smart phones, automated behavioral coding, wearable technologies, and psychophysiological data. Often the end goal is to arrive at a better understanding of individuals’ processes. From these individual-level findings, we can get closer to personalized interventions as well as obtain insights into meaningful similarities across individuals and aspects of human processes that may generalize to the population. Arriving at personalized dynamic models often requires the use and adaptation of machine learning methods such as unsupervised classification, feature selection, and model-building. This talk focuses on the application of such methods on a few data sets collected across various domains of psychological inquiry including self-report data and functional MRI.\n\n\nBio\nDr. Kathleen Gates is an associate professor of Quantitative Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is a member of the Human Neuroimaging Group and affiliated faculty of the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC). She obtained her Ph.D. in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (quant focus) at Penn State, a Masters of Forensic Psychology at the City University of New York (John Jay College), and a BS in Psychology from Michigan State University. Dr.’s work is motivated by problems in analyzing individual-level data. She develops algorithms and programs that may aid researchers in better quantifying behavioral, psychophysiological, and emotional processes across time. She is a co-inventor of GIMME, an algorithm for finding mathematical models of psychophysiological processes across time. The end goal is to help researchers identify patterns within individuals so we can provide person-specific prevention, treatment, and intervention protocols as well as better understand the varied basic physiological underpinnings for emotions, cognition, and behaviors."

    "text": "Date: April 6, 2023\nSpeaker: Amanda Kay Montoya, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Psychology\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nMediation and moderation analysis are ubiquitous throughout psychological research and help address questions about when and why effects occur. Research practices within psychology have grown and evolved in reaction to the replicability crisis, including new steps to study planning (e.g., preregistration) and increased attention to existing practices (e.g., power analysis). As such, methodologists need to incorporate these new priorities as part of their work developing and evaluating statistical methods and when creating tools to aid researchers in their analyses. In this talk, I overview my work on mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis in two-instance repeated-measures designs, a very commonly used design in psychology. I have developed an easy to use macro which can be used to estimate these models as well as implement resampling methods for inference, assist with generating plots, and many other useful features. I demonstrate how integrating meta-scientific methods to evaluate current practice in mediation and moderation, and aiding researchers in implementing preregistration and sample size planning. Overall, research suggests there is reason to be concerned about the quality of evidence from published mediation and moderated mediation results. My lab has worked to develop tools and evaluate methods for sample size planning and preregistration, which should improve this quality of evidence. I discuss future direction of my research, including extending to more complex outcomes in mediation and moderation."

West, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nArizona State University\nFreie Universität Berlin\nVideo Recording (requires sign in using your USC NetID)\n\nAbstract\nThe replication crisis has been a source of considerable concern in psychology and other sciences over the past decade. This presentation provides a methodological, philosophical, and statistical view of the replication crisis. After a brief overview, I consider recent work on three related reasons for replication failure: (1) poor methodological technique and heterogeneity of effects, (2) insufficient statistical power, and (3) reproducibility issues including undisclosed researcher degrees of freedom in reporting and “the garden of forking paths” in statistical analysis. I also consider some new developments and several proposed solutions that may mitigate problems in replicating previous studies. New methods of statistical power analysis capture the uncertainty of effect size estimates and provide more realistic estimates of required sample size. Methods related to meta-analysis that do not treat the original study as a privileged gold standard offer better information about the statistical significance, average effect size, and variability of effect size of a series of replication studies. The extensive resources devoted to the replication crisis, which only addresses the association between two variables, may have diverted attention from other equally important forms of validity in research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Date: December 1, 2022\nSpeaker: Kevin J. Grimm, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nDepartment of Psychology\nArizona State University\n\nAbstract\nItem factor analysis models can be estimated using a marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimator or a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator. The MML estimator is a full information estimator, whereas the WLS estimator is a limited-information estimator based on first and second-order moments. In single group item factor analysis, the choice of estimator is often a matter of convenience even though each estimator has benefits and limitations. However, in multiple group item factor analyses, there are parameter and specification differences as unique factor variances can be estimated under certain conditions using WLS estimators. Thus, when examining measurement invariance with WLS, researchers can study the invariance of the factor loadings, thresholds, and unique variances following the work of Millsap (2012). This is not the case when using MML because the unique variances are assumed to be equal across groups (or time), which places the focus on the factor loadings and the thresholds. Importantly, a lack of invariance in the unique variances over groups (and time) can masquerade as a lack of threshold invariance when using the MML estimator, which affects researchers’ ability to compare latent variable scores over groups (and time). This issue and the importance of this distinction is illustrated using simulated and empirical data.\n\n\nBio\nKevin Grimm is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University.
