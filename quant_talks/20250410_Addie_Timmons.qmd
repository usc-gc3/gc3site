### Abstract

As the demand for scalable, effective, and personalized mental health interventions grows, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies offers unprecedented opportunities to transform care. I will present preliminary findings from an ongoing clinical trial to evaluate a micro-experimental intervention aimed at improving emotional regulation and stress resilience in kids and families. This trial employs an adaptive design to optimize intervention components in real-time, based on individual response patterns and contextual data. The talk will highlight how AI-driven analytics and just-in-time intervention delivery are being used to tailor support at the moment itâ€™s needed most, advancing the promise of precision mental health. I will also discuss challenges and lessons learned from implementing this approach, and future directions for deploying scalable digital interventions across clinical and community settings.
