### Abstract

This talk provides an overview of ongoing work in our research group, JAStaG ([jastag.org](http://jastag.org/)), which focuses on methods and statistical approaches for analyzing complex data in psychology and the social sciences. I will outline key areas of our work, including longitudinal and multilevel modeling, and discuss how these approaches address common challenges in empirical research. Throughout the talk, I will highlight how our work on methods and statistics is relevant for substantive research questions across a range of domains.
