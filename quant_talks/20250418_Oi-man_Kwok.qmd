### Abstract

Multilevel modeling (MLM)—also known as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) or mixed-effects modeling—is widely used for analyzing nested data in the social sciences. In this presentation, I will highlight several key concepts in MLM, beginning with variance decomposition and intraclass correlation. I will then focus on predictor centering, emphasizing the importance of group-mean centering for lower-level predictors and its implications for testing contextual effects. The presentation will conclude with practical recommendations for analyzing multilevel data.
