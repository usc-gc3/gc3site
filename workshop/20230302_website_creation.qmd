### Abstract

Do you want an easy-to-maintain personal website while showcasing your R skills? We are going to hold a workshop on creating personal websites using R Quarto! Quarto is a next-generation version of R Markdown and provides a quick and convenient way to publish documents. In an hour, we will make sure you will have a well-constructed skeleton of your site and deploy it on Quarto Pub before you step out of the GC-3 Center.
